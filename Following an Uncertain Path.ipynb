      "I show how to steer a car along an uncertain path. The controller can steer, accelerate and deccelerate the car and turn the steering wheel. But there are constraints on the acceleration, the rate at which the wheel can be steer, and the steering angle. The goal is to follow the path with high fidelity close to a given target speed, subject to these constraints on the controls.\n",

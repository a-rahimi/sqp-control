      "I show how to steer a car along an uncertain path. The controller can steer, accelerate and deccelerate the car, but there are constraints and penalties for certain motions. The goal is to follow the path with high fidelity, subject to the constraints and penalties imposed on the controller.\n",

      "The state of the car is its position $x\\in\\R^2$, velocity $\\dx\\in\\R^2$, and direction of the steering wheel $\\theta$.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its control inputs are acceleration $\\ddx\\in\\R$ and steering $\\dtheta\\in\\R$.  Define the unit vector $v(\\theta)$ that points along $\\theta$.\n",

I say \"signed distance\" because it takes on positive values on the right of the path and negative values to the left of the path.  We are allowed deviations of at most $\\Delta$ in either direction.\n",
